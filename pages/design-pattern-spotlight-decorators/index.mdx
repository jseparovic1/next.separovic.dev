## The pattern

We're a team of developers so naturally there was no way we could convince ourselves to use something off-the-shelf, and opted to build something simple and custom with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org).

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.

There are a lot of things to like about Next.js, but the primary reason we decided to use it is that it has great support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is the format we wanted to use to author our posts.

```md
# My first MDX post

MDX is a really cool authoring format because it lets
you embed React components right in your markdown:

<MyComponent myProp={5} />

How cool is that?
```
